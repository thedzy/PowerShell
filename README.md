# Powershell

A collection of shell, scripts, source, functions and commands to help you get started or complete an existing project. \
**Note**: I am not an expert in PowerShell, rather fairly new to it.  It is **VERY** posible that there are better ways than what's here. But we all start somewhere

## Words of caution
Like all code, don't copy and paste without understanding, always exercise caution.  With that, there is nothing intentionally malicious here. Follow the link for that. \

## FAQ
### Why PowerShell if I am not an expert at it?
3 reasons. First is that you don't get to be an expert without starting.  The second is that it doesn't mean the code cannot be useful.  And finally, this is just as much my reference as it's someone elses.

### Why bother sharing it all?
Same as above.

### Why is there so little here?
I am getting there?
